<H3>Business Questions / Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</H3>

The project aims to answer the following key business questions:

* Total Bookings: How many rides were booked during the selected time period?
* Revenue Performance: What is the total booking value generated?
* Booking Status Breakdown: How many bookings were successful, canceled by customers, canceled by drivers, or failed due to driver unavailability?
* Ride Volume Over Time: How does ride volume vary across different days of the month?
* Cancellation Insights: What percentage of bookings are canceled by customers vs drivers?
* Customer Ratings (if available): How do customer ratings reflect service quality?

<H3>Process</H3>

* SQL for Data Extraction & Preparation: We begin by teaching you how to use SQL to query large datasets, clean and prepare data efficiently, and handle complex data structures. You’ll learn practical techniques to solve real-life data challenges and gain confidence in working with relational databases.

* Excel for Data Analysis: Once the data is extracted, we move to Excel for deeper analysis. From data sorting and pivot tables to advanced formulas, you’ll discover how to perform meaningful data interpretation and summarization. This phase highlights Excel’s versatility in handling various analytical tasks.

* Power BI for Dashboard Creation: Finally, we show you how to transform your insights into impactful visual stories using Power BI. You’ll learn to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that communicates key findings effectively, making complex data accessible to stakeholders.
